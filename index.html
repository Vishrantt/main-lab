<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Multi-Agent Intelligent Networks (MAIN) lab at Purdue ECE works on </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Foundational Theory</strong>: We are interested in optimizing communication and networking to build infrastructure of the future and enable networked intelligence at scale. This encompasses analyzing systems ranging from local wireless networks, to next-generation mobile and edge networks, to large-scale cloud infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>System Design and Implementation</strong>: We apply the insights gained from rigorous analysis to the creation of high-performing systems. We often implement our algorithms on software defined radios and UAVs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Impact</strong>: We are driven by the potential of applying our foundational innovations in theory and systems to solve challenging problems, especially in the fields of intelligent robotics and autonomous systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our work has a strong foundation in classical tools and techniques including <strong>probability and optimization</strong>, modeling wireless systems, graph algorithms, queuing, and <strong>control theory</strong> as well as tools from <strong>machine learning</strong> such as multi-armed bandits and online learning. We regularly collaborate with experts in control and robotics as well as cloud networking to directly impact multiple research communities.</p>
<p>Priot to setting up this lab at Purdue, Vishrant (PI of MAIN lab) was at MIT, working with <a href="https://modiano.mit.edu"  >Prof. Eytan Modiano</a>. You can find press coverage of some of his prior work at the following links - <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-traffic-cop-algorithm-drone-swarm-wireless-0313"  >MIT News</a>, <a href="https://aeroastro.mit.edu/news-impact/new-traffic-cop-algorithm-helps-a-drone-swarm-stay-on-task/"  >AeroAstro@MIT</a>, <a href="https://computing.mit.edu/news/new-traffic-cop-algorithm-helps-a-drone-swarm-stay-on-task/"  >Schwarzman College of Computing MIT</a>, <a href="https://idss.mit.edu/news/new-traffic-cop-algorithm-helps-a-drone-swarm-stay-on-task/"  >Institute for Data Systems and Society MIT</a>, <a href="https://wca.org/a-new-wireless-algorithm-helps-drones-stay-focused-on-tasks/"  >Wireless Communications Alliance</a>, <a href="https://aimagazine.com/articles/robots-and-drones-demanding-data-for-life-or-death-decisions"  >AI Magazine</a>, <a href="https://www.hackster.io/news/don-t-let-the-past-slow-you-down-97410db15624"  >Hackster.io</a>, <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2023-03-traffic-cop-algorithm-drone-swarm.html"  >TechXplore</a>, <a href="https://www.autonomousvehicleinternational.com/news/connectivity/mit-engineers-develop-wiswarm-to-prioritize-wi-fi-data-transfer.html"  >Autonomous Vehicle International</a>,
