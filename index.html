<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Multi-Agent Intelligent Networks (MAIN) lab at Purdue ECE works on </p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Foundational Theory</b>: We are interested in optimizing communication and networking to build infrastructure of the future and enable networked intelligence at scale. This encompasses analyzing systems ranging from local wireless networks, to next-generation mobile and edge networks, to large-scale cloud infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>System Design and Implementation</b>: We apply the insights gained from rigorous analysis to the creation of high-performing systems. We often implement our algorithms on software defined radios and UAVs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Impact</b>: We are driven by the potential of applying our foundational innovations in theory and systems to solve challenging problems, especially in the fields of intelligent robotics and autonomous systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Our work has a strong foundation in classical tools and techniques including <b>probability and optimization</b>, modeling wireless systems, graph algorithms, queuing, and <b>control theory</b> as well as tools from <b>machine learning</b> such as multi-armed bandits and online learning. We regularly collaborate with experts in control and robotics as well as cloud networking to directly impact multiple research communities.</p>
<p>Prior to setting up this lab at Purdue, Vishrant (PI of MAIN lab) was at MIT, working with <a href="https://modiano.mit.edu">Prof. Eytan Modiano</a>.
